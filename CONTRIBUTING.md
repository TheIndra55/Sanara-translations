You are welcome to contribute if you want to, but please follow these steps:

- If your language doesn't exist, please create it inside the "Translations" folder. (Please try to keep the name of the folder of 2 letters, french: fr, english: en, japanese: jp...)
- You can then create a file 'terms.json' that contain all translations, you can take example of the [english file](https://github.com/Xwilarg/Sanara-translations/blob/master/Translations/en/terms.json).
- Once you made progress on your translation, please make a pull request.
